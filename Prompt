Chapter 1: The Problem and Its Setting
Introduction Component

Purpose: Establishes the broader context and significance of the research topic

Example from BACE Study:

The agricultural sector plays a significant role in a country's economy. Some of the known activities incorporated in the field of agriculture are cultivating soil, harvesting crops, and even raising livestock. In accordance with Prof. Dr. Awan and Aslam (2015), the overall growth rate of a country's economy depends on the growth rate of agriculture. The blooming of this sector is the primary instrument for the mitigation of poverty in rural areas.

Component-Specific Literature Component

Purpose: Reviews research on each study component

Example from BACE Study:

## Eggshells

An eggshell is the outermost layer of an egg, and most of it is calcium carbonate. According to Karetnick (2023), eggshells can be added to plants to improve their growth as it is a major source of calcium carbonate. These shells can be used even if they are plain white, brown, or speckled shells. When fruits start to ripen, some rotting may appear at the end of the fruits. This happens because of the lack of calcium in the fruit, this lack of calcium can be caused by an imbalance in the soil pH or due to the absence or excessiveness of water. Calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) helps in neutralizing the soil pH level specifically by reducing the concentration of aluminum in the soil.

        Example: The study implies connections between:
            Mean: for descriptive measurement of plant characteristics
            t-test: for comparing two groups (addressing hypothesis 2)
            ANOVA: for comparing multiple groups (addressing hypothesis 1)
        Template:

        [Statistical method 1] will be used to [specific purpose related to research question 1].
        [Statistical method 2] will be used to [specific purpose related to research question 2].

Data Gathering Component

Purpose: Explains how data will be collected

Example from BACE Study:

## Data Gathering

The data in this research will be gathered by observing the characteristics of the pechay planted with different ratios of the BACE (Bonemeal, Aloe vera, Charcoal & Eggshells) fertilizer. The pechays would all be treated the same way. It would be taken care of and observed regularly. After forty days, these characteristics will be measured:

The first characteristic is the height of the pechay. After forty days, the height of each pechays with different amounts the BACE components would be measured. The measuring device that will be used to measure the height of the pechay is a measuring tape.

Detailed Structure Pattern:

    Explain when measurements will be taken
        Example: "After forty days, these characteristics will be measured..."
        Template: "After [specific time period], [variables] will be measured."

    Specify exact measurement tools and processes
        Example: "The measuring device that will be used to measure the height of the pechay is a measuring tape."
        Template: "The [specific tool] will be used to measure the [variable] by [specific measurement process]."

    Detail sample handling and preparation
        Example: "The pechays are going to be cleaned and the excess dirt will be removed and then it will be weighed."
        Template: "The [samples] will be [preparation steps] before [measurement process]."

    Describe data recording methods
        Example: The study implies data will be recorded on an observation sheet
        Template: "Data will be recorded using [specific recording method/tool]. Each [measurement] will be [recording process] to ensure [data quality goal]."

    Connect data gathering directly to research variables
        Example:

        The first characteristic is the height of the pechay...
        The second characteristic that will be gathered is the width of the leaves...
        The third characteristic that is going to be measured is the weight of the plant...

        Template:

        The [ordinal] characteristic is the [specific variable]. This relates to [research question/hypothesis] by [connection].

Ethical Considerations Component

Purpose: Addresses ethical aspects of research

Example from BACE Study:

## Ethical Considerations
